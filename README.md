# airlocked-agents

**Deterministic IaC for a private, self-hosted AI automation stack — untrusted content stays in the airlock.**

Idempotent setup for the architecture described in *The Recommended Setup — Architecture & Build Guide*: a local model + second brain on your Mac, an n8n automation glue and a sandboxed Suna research rig on a VPS, wired through a private tunnel, with Claude + MCP used cloud-side for public work only.

The whole point of this repo is to keep one rule true automatically: **no single component reads untrusted content, holds your credentials, and can send — all at once.**

**Topics** (set automatically by `make repo`, or add them in the GitHub UI):
`infrastructure-as-code` · `ansible` · `docker-compose` · `self-hosted` · `ai-agents` · `privacy` · `security` · `llm` · `local-first` · `n8n` · `mcp` · `homelab` · `prompt-injection` · `automation` · `llama-cpp`

Not to be confused with [`NevaMind-AI/airlock`](https://github.com/NevaMind-AI/airlock) — that's a Python egress-guard *library* you embed; this is a deployed *stack* you run.

## What is deterministic vs. what is manual (read this first)

Honest IaC draws the line clearly. This repo does too.

**Fully deterministic + idempotent (run as many times as you like):**
- All package installs (Homebrew on the Mac, Docker on the VPS).
- The container stacks (n8n, Khoj) via Docker Compose.
- Every config file, rendered from templates with your variables.
- Service enablement (launchd on Mac, systemd/Compose on VPS).
- The VPS firewall (ufw) and the Mac↔VPS WireGuard tunnel.
- n8n credential placeholders and workflow import scaffolding.

**Manual, one-time, by design (cannot be deterministic — interactive consent):**
- **Gmail OAuth** — Google requires browser consent; you create the OAuth app and paste client id/secret, then authorize once in the n8n UI.
- **Telegram bot token** — created interactively via `@BotFather`.
- **Supabase project** for Suna — create the project (cloud or self-hosted) and paste its keys.
- **Model download** — scriptable (`make model`) but it is a multi-GB file, so it is opt-in.
- **VPS provisioning** — bring your own host; an optional Terraform module is noted but not vendor-locked here.

Everything manual is reduced to filling `.env` and a 5-item checklist in `docs-MANUAL-STEPS.md`. Nothing secret is ever committed.

## Prerequisites

- A Mac (Apple Silicon assumed) with Homebrew, and Docker Desktop.
- A small Linux VPS you can SSH into (Debian/Ubuntu assumed), 2 GB RAM is enough for n8n; Suna wants ~16 GB or a separate box.
- `ansible` and `make` on the machine you run this from (`brew install ansible make`).
- Your llama.cpp model file (or run `make model` to fetch one).

## Publishing to GitHub

```bash
make repo                       # uses the gh CLI: init, commit, create, push
# or with options:
make repo NAME=my-stack VIS=public
```

The bootstrap script refuses to commit if any secret-like file (`.env`, keys, rendered
`*.conf`) is staged, and asks for confirmation before creating the remote. CI then runs on
every PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # then edit .env with your values
make help                     # list targets
make mac                      # provision the Mac (idempotent)
make vps                      # provision the VPS (idempotent, over public SSH)
make tunnel                   # bring up the WireGuard link
make harden                   # lock VPS SSH to the tunnel (after the tunnel is up; recommended)
make workflows                # import the n8n workflow skeletons
make verify                   # run health + boundary checks
```

Each target is safe to re-run; Ansible converges to the declared state. To tear down the container stacks: `make down`.

## The determinism guarantee, restated

`make mac && make vps && make tunnel` converges the same way every time from a clean host, given the same `.env`. The only things it cannot create for you are the three interactive secrets above — and that is a property of OAuth and bot registration, not a limitation of this repo. See `docs-MANUAL-STEPS.md`.

## Security notes baked in

- Local services (llama.cpp, Khoj) bind to `127.0.0.1`; the model is re-exposed to the VPS only on the WireGuard tunnel interface — verified by `make verify`.
- The VPS firewall allows exactly three inbound rules — SSH (22), HTTPS (443), WireGuard (UDP) — with HTTPS the only application ingress; `make verify` asserts the exact set. After `make harden`, SSH is locked to the WireGuard tunnel peer (no public SSH).
- The n8n write path is credential-isolated and human-gated; the allowlist guard is embedded directly in `n8n/workflow.write-path.json` (canonical source: `n8n/allowlist.code.js`), so an import is guarded out of the box.
- Sensitive research routes to the local model over the tunnel (via a socat proxy on the Mac); nothing private egresses to the cloud.
- `make verify` runs the allowlist guard self-test (`scripts/injection-selftest.sh`); the full end-to-end prompt-injection test is manual — see `scripts/injection-selftest.md`.

Commands and image tags drift; pin versions in `.env` and re-run `make verify` after upgrades.
